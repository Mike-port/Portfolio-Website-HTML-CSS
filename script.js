The elevation in an airplane can have a detrimental effect on our ability to taste things. According to a 2010 study conducted by Germany\s Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics, the dryness experienced at a high elevation as well as low pressure reduces the sensitivity of a personâ€™s taste buds to sweet and salty foods by about 30 percent. Add that dry cabin air affects our ability to smell, and our ability to taste is reduced further.'
